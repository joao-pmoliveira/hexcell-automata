# Cellular Automata in Hexagonal Cells

Implementation of the popular cellular automata model.

_note: hexagonal shaped cells were intended, but reproduced less interesting results visually so I reverted back to standard pixels._

## How to run

To compile and run the program run:

    build.bat
    run.bat

or simply:

    build && run

## Dependencies

For the visualization of the cellular automata in action, this program uses `raylib`.
Link to library [here](raylib.com).
