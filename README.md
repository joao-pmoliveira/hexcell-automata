# Cellular Automata in Hexagonal Cells
Implementation of the popular cellular automata model but using hexagonal cells.
Hexagonal cells influence mainly how and which neighboring cells are taken into account for the status of the current cell.

## How to run

To compile and run the program run:

    build.bat
    run.bat

or simply:

    build && run


## Dependencies

For the visualization of the cellular automata in action, this program uses `raylib`.
Link to library [here](raylib.com).
